Issue Summary:

On May 10th, 2023, our cloud storage service experienced a four-hour outage from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM PST, during which users were unable to access their files. The outage impacted 50% of our users and caused significant disruptions to their daily workflows.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a software bug in one of our servers that caused the server to crash, leading to an inability to access the affected files.
Timeline:
8:00 AM PST: Our monitoring system detected a high rate of errors on the affected server, signaling an outage.
8:05 AM PST: We dispatched an engineer to investigate the issue and determine the cause.
8:15 AM PST: The engineer identified the affected server and attempted to restore access to the files.
9:00 AM PST: The engineer confirmed that the issue was caused by a software bug and escalated the issue to our development team for coordination.
10:30 AM PST: Our development team began working on a fix for the software bug.
12:00 PM PST: The software bug was fixed, and the affected files were restored. The service was fully operational again.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
Our engineer initially suspected a network connectivity problem due to some users reporting slow upload and download speeds, which resulted in some time being spent on network troubleshooting before the root cause was correctly identified as a software bug.
Actions Taken:
Once we confirmed the software bug, our development team quickly coordinated the deployment of the fix. We provided frequent updates to our users through our social media channels and email communications to keep them informed throughout the outage.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a software bug in one of our servers. We fixed the bug and restored the affected files. Moving forward, we will implement additional testing to detect and prevent similar software bugs.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent future incidents, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:
Increase testing to identify and fix potential software bugs.
Improve our disaster recovery plan to minimize the impact of software bugs and other types of outages.
Increase infrastructure redundancy to reduce the likelihood of widespread outages.
Conduct regular reviews of our systems and processes to identify areas for improvement.
Develop a communication plan to promptly notify users of outages and provide status updates.
Conclusion:
We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this outage and are committed to delivering a reliable and high-quality service to our users. We have taken steps to address the root cause of the issue and will continue to improve our systems and processes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
